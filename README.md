# Full React App

## Overview
This app contains the following technologies:
- ReactJS
  - Server rendering
  - Loadable Components (lazy loading)
  - Setup with Redux (Actions, Reducers)
- Sass
- Babel with ES6 features
- ESlint
- Webpack
- Dotenv
- Testing
  - Jest snapshot tests
  - React-testing-library feature tests
  - Selenium tests

## Goals
This app is fully tested, with focus on output

This app is always up-to-date. Every time a new version of any of the used technologies is released, a new branch is created and automatically tested. If tests fail, the bug will be fixed in that and all concurrent versions.

This app is easy to use as a boilerplate for new projects. Running in Docker container where only the required folders are mapped as volumes
